phred=
## Minimum overlap length between the read and the linker in 
## forward reads. If the overlap is shorter than LENGTH, the
## read is not modified. This reduces the number of bases 
## trimmed purely due to short random adapter matches (default:5)

## Minimum overlap length between the read and the linker in 
## forward reads.(default:4)
revmin=
## The minimum required overlap length between two 
## reads to provide a confident overlap in stitching. (default:10)
